                    <p>
                        Skilled Full Stack Software Engineer with a background
                        in web development. I have a deep understanding of both
                        front-end and back-end technologies such as Angular,
                        Flutter, NodeJS and some BaaS like Firebase. Throughout
                        my career, I have successfully built projects ranging
                        from small-scale applications to more complex systems. I
                        am passionate about creating efficient and scalable
                        code, and I always strive to stay up-to-date with the
                        latest industry trends and best practices.
